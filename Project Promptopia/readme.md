Hi! Thank you for coming, this is promptopia. A personal project that i make, based on the tutorial of NEXT.js in Youtube. 

I try to learn how to use NEXT.js through this project, i'm aware, that it can't prove that I'm good on next based on a tutorial I seen on youtube. But this is just a little demonstration of my will that I love to learn something new and explore the resources needed as a Developer.

Promptopia is a website made so that people could share prompt that are useful by them and share it with others. They could post the prompt and the tag, and other user could see and copy the text. Main Feature of this website is CRUD as follows:

    - User can create account by login through google.
    - if logged/not logged, user can see the prompt that has been created by other user. and copied it straight to their keyboard.
    - If logged, user can create a post and will be displayed in the main page.
    - If logged, user can edit or delete the post that they make.

// ---------------Techy Stuff -----------------//

The tech stack used in this website is as follows:
    - MongoDB & Mongoose 
    - React & Next (V.13)
    - Tailwind as Style Library

There are 3 HTTP methods used in this website, GET, POST and PATCH can be seen on client > app > api > folders
